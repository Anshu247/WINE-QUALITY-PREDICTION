# WINE-QUALITY-PREDICTION

🍷📊 Excited to share my Wine Quality Prediction Machine Learning project! 📈🍇
In this project, I've explored the fascinating world of wine quality assessment using data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. Here's a brief overview of what I've accomplished:

1. 📋 Data Exploration and Preprocessing: I started by loading a dataset containing various attributes of wines and their quality ratings. I performed data profiling, checked for missing values, and conducted a statistical summary analysis to gain insights into the data.

2. 📊 Data Visualization: Visualizing the data is crucial, and I used Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create informative visualizations. I explored the distribution of wine quality ratings, correlations between attributes, scatter plots, and box plots to better understand the dataset.

3. 🧐 Feature Engineering: To enhance the model's performance, I categorized wine quality into three groups and introduced a 'rating' feature. This new feature helped in achieving a more balanced dataset and improved the predictive power of the model.

4. 🔀 Over-sampling: I used SMOTE to address class imbalance and ensure that all wine quality ratings were represented more equally.

5. 📏 Standardization: Standardizing the data was essential to bring all features to the same scale. I utilized StandardScaler to achieve this, which improved model performance.

6. 📈 Linear Regression and Random Forest: I implemented Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression algorithms to predict wine quality ratings. This project allowed me to compare the performance of these models in terms of Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R-squared Score, and Adjusted R-squared Score.

7. 🍇 Predictions: The models were able to make predictions, offering insights into wine quality based on the input attributes. The Random Forest model, in particular, demonstrated excellent performance.
